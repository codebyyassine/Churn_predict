## Migration Steps

1. Run database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Update environment variables:
```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
```

3. Restart the application:
```bash
docker-compose restart web
```

## API Documentation
- Added detailed API documentation in `docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md`
- Added frontend implementation guide in `docs/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Testing Instructions
1. Configure Discord webhook in admin panel
2. Test alert triggers:
   - Create high-risk customer
   - Update customer risk scores
   - Check Discord for notifications
3. View alert history and stats
4. Check risk monitoring dashboard

## Security Considerations
- All new endpoints require admin authentication
- Webhook URL is stored securely
- Alert history includes error tracking
- Rate limiting applied to webhook calls

## Performance Considerations
- Added database indexes for frequent queries
- Implemented pagination for alert history
- Optimized dashboard queries with aggregation
- Added caching headers for static responses

## Future Improvements
1. Add more alert channels (email, Slack)
2. Implement alert templates customization
3. Add real-time WebSocket updates for dashboard
4. Add alert scheduling and quiet hours
5. Implement alert acknowledgment system
